## Spectrum-Efficiency and Fairness with Distributed Finite-Resolution Intelligent Surfaces and Imperfect CSI

These codes simulate the results of the paper in MATLAB. They include the following results:

### The comparsion results between distributed RISs and the centralized RIS
These codes evaluate the results that are depicted in Fig.5 and Fig.7.

### The comparsion results between the proposed optimization method and two methods based on successive-refinement (SR)
These codes compare the performance of our proposed approach with two SR-based methods when we use a centralized RIS with noisy and noiseles channels. Specifically, these codes represent the results of Fig. 8, Fig. 9, and Fig. 10 in the paper. 

Note: In each folder, you need to run "Main_File.m" to get the results.
