## Spectrum-Efficiency with Distributed Finite-Resolution Intelligent Surfaces and imperfect channel knowledge

These codes simulate the results of the paper in MATLAB. They include the following results:

### The comparsion results between distributed RISs and the centralized RIS
These codes evaluate the results that are depicted in Fig.?? and Fig.??.

### The comparsion results between the proposed optimization method and the refinmenet method
These codes compare the performance of our proposed approach with the refinmenet method when we use a centralized RIS with noisy and noiseles channels. Specifically, these codes represent the results of Fig. 5, Fig. 6, and Fig. 7 in the paper. 

Note: In each folder, you need to run "Main_Running_File.m" to get the results.
